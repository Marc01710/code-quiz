# code-quiz

## Description

- My motivation came from wanting to be able to use the knowledge I learned about JavaScript to make a code quiz webpage to ask questions and answer them, if I get an answer wrong it will deduct time and at the end I mayh put in my initials and see a scoreboard that shows my initials and my score.
- I worked on this project to test my knowledge of JavaScript and make a code quiz that asks questions, has a timer and allows me to put my initials and score at the end of the quiz.
- The problem that this project solves is having a webpage that I can go to to test my coding knowledge with a coding quiz
- I learned that I am able to put the skills I learned in class to create a code quiz website using JavaScript.
